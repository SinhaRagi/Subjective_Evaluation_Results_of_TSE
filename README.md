Subjective_Evaluation_Results_of_TSE

Objective measures:
  1. Scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR (in dB))
  2. Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)
  3. Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI)
  4. Word error rate (WER)

The test-data (3mix) is completely disjoint than the one used for training for both these models:--> test data is taken from Librispeech dataset, while training was performed on WSJ0 dataset and WHAM! dataset.
